_Messenger_ is a simple messaging application where registered users can post messages. The project acts as an example project for a single-page application implemented with Spring Boot and React.

## Architecture overview

The project architecture consists of the _backend application_ and the _frontend application_. The backend application is a RESTful web service implemented with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). It provides a REST API endpoints for the frontend application. The backend application's authentication is implemented with a stateless [JWT token](https://jwt.io/introduction) authentication. The backend application uses [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) as a development environment database and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a production environment database.

The frontend application is implemented with [React](https://react.dev/). The user-interface is implemented with [Material UI](https://mui.com/). The [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool is used to develop and build the frontend application.

## Usage guide

### Backend

The backend application requires Java 17 as a minimum version.

You need to perform the following steps to setup the backend application:

1. Add a `application-local.properties` file to the `src/main/resources` folder (same folder that has the `application.properties` file) with the following content:

   ```
   auth.jwt-secret=<jwt-secret>
   ```

   Replace the `<jwt-secret>` with a string that has at least 32 characters.

Then, you can start the backend application by performing the following steps:

1. Start the server by running the `./mvnw spring-boot:run` command
2. Once the server has started, the application is accessible at <http://localhost:8080>

#### Running tests

You can run the backend tests by running the `./mvnw test` command.

#### Running with Docker

Docker can be used to deploy the backend application or run it locally. In the production environment, the Docker container requires the environment variables defined in the [application-production.properties](https://github.com/Kaltsoon/spring-boot-vite-example/blob/main/src/main/resources/application-production.properties) file.

The backend application can be started with Docker by performing the following steps:

1. Build the image by running the `docker build . -t messenger-backend` command
2. Create and start the container by running the `docker run -p 8080:8080 messenger-backend` command
3. Once the server has started, the application is accessible at <http://localhost:8080>

### Frontend

The frontend application requires Node.js 18 as a minimum version.

You can start the frontend application by performing the following steps in the `frontend` folder:

1. Install the dependencies by running the `npm install` command
2. Start the Vite development server by running the `npm run dev` command
3. Once the development server has started, the application is accessible at <http://localhost:5173>
